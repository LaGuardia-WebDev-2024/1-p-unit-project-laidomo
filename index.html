    <h1> Why I Love These Artists💕</h1>
    <body> 
     1. I love Sza's music because I resonate with her music a lot & her music is very nice to listen to. She doesn't make the same type of music everytime either, like on <strong><em> SOS</em></strong> she explored different generes of music.<br>
     2.I love Mariah the Scientist's music because she has a beautiful voice and her music tells a story.<br>
     3.I love Summer Walkers music because her voice, like Mariah's is very beautiful and soft. One of my favorite songs by her is <strong><em> Karma </em></strong> it's the perfect first listen if you've already heard <strong><em>Girls Need Love</em></strong><br>
     4.I love Party Next Door's music because his music is very cool and I like his auto-tune.<br>
     5.I love Beyonce's music because who <em> doesn't </em> like Beyonce.
